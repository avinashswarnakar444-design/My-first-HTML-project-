 <h1>hello!</h1> 
 <p>The word “Hello” is one of the simplest yet most powerful greetings in the world. It is often the first word we use to start a conversation, to show respect, or to express friendliness. A simple “Hello” can brighten someone’s day, break the silence, and create a connection between people. It is a universal gesture of kindness that crosses cultures and languages, reminding us that communication begins with warmth and positivity. Saying “Hello” may seem small, but it carries the ability to open doors to new relationships, opportunities, and understanding.
